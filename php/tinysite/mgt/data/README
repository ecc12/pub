TINYSITE v1.00

CREDIT

Cameron King put this quick hack of a CMF together to meet his own needs.
Because TinySite builds on other LGPL code, TinySite itself is released
under the LGPL v3 http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html.  See COPYING
for more details.

Smarty and TinyMCE are both LGPL projects that have been bundled with 
this package.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Extract the tinysite tarball into a web-accessible directory.  

2. Ensure that the mgt/data directory cannot be read by visitors.  You can do
this with an .htaccess file in apache (see PROTECTME for example).

3. Update the master password at the top of index.php with either a sha1/md5
hash or plaintext password.  This password will edit or create any page.

4. Update the template in mgt/data/templates/index.tpl

5. Start editing!

SPECIAL PROTECTION ON A FILE

If you want to protect a single page with an additional password in top of
the master password, create a file for that page at mgt/data/meta/pagename.pw
containing additional passwords, one per line.  There are no usernames.
